		<div class="section-card-text" id="sectionCardText1">As a person gets more involved in online spaces, be that social media, video games, chat rooms or blogs, they usually begin to see those spaces and connections as more real. Friends that are made can feel just as real as physical friends. While those who are not as invested or spend less time in online spaces feel that those relationships are different, more distant and not as personal.</div>

		<div class="section-card-text" id="sectionCardText2">There are outliers to this of course, with people forming close bonds with others online, even when they donâ€™t use social media or play games very often. Sometimes, their very relationship with the virtual space itself changes, like with certain attachments to a social media platform, or a favourite game.</div>

		<div class="section-card-text" id="sectionCardText3">Due to this relationship change, people might become more critical of their favourite spaces, but the inverse is also true, with some blindly trusting those spaces regardless of their actual quality. Because of these varying levels of connects with other in online spaces, those with differing opinions occasionally butt heads due to just how different their own experiences are.</div>
